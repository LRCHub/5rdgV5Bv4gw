Somewhere in history
When the world was blind
They created an instrument
To control our minds
Then they spread the fear
Of a revengeful god
And the people believed
Put their trust in a fraud
But now the time has come
For you to open your eyes
To question your leaders
Their empire of lies
Hell I know how to use my brain
So don't tell me I'm lost
I don't respond to your manipulation
You're goin' down, you and your motherfuckin' cross

This is a revolution
This is a brand new dawn
We're bringing down your system
We're bringing down your law
No more religious shackles
No more pointless wars
This is a revolution
We're bringing down your law

(...till the Vatican falls)

I'm so sick of your stories and contradictions
Your holy book is just another piece of fiction
Now listen for once to that shit you're spitting out
Don't you realize how motherfucking stupid you sound?
Nah, you're the masters of ignorance
Your self-delusion almost passes as insolence
That madness ain't coincidence cause that's how it goes
If the church pollutes your brain and your motherfuckin' soul

Religious propaganda / from the United States
Trying to infiltrate us with Christian faith
So fuck you, Rick Santorum! We join the fight
As soon as (hed) p.e. and Freezes Deyna unite
All them fundamentalist conservative politicians
Are so ridiculous when they persist on their mission
I fucking laugh at them, pathetic fools

religio est perdelira

And they crucify the truth!

Watch for the blackout
Watch for the breakdown

I just don't get it, I don't know what it is
That a lot of people still believe in this shit
Why are you afraid to think for yourself, being yourself, leaving your shell?
Time to get rid of that burden on your mind
That rat, that feeds on your conscience all the time
Nothing's for sure anyway in this life, so I'd rather die in surprise than live for a lie

Rebels never die!

No! You can't control us anymore!
